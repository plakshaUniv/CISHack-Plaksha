Description:

With the growth of e-commerce websites online payments, people and financial companies rely a lot on online services to carry out their transactions that have led to an exponential increase in the credit card frauds.
Fraudulent credit card transactions lead to a loss of huge amount of money. The design of an effective fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the losses incurred by the
customers and financial companies. Our fraud prevention system called imposTer.ai can save consumers millions of dollars per year. We utilise benchmark machine learning models on real-world e-commerce transactions that contains a wide range of features from device type to product features.
